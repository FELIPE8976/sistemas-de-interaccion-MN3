## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on the **construction of music** for a 2-minute gameplay of **"Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare"**, a survival horror game known for its intense atmosphere and eerie sound design. The goal of this project was to create a soundtrack that enhances the horror elements of the gameplay by reflecting the game's dark and suspenseful environment.

The process of constructing the music involved the following steps:

- **Atmospheric Soundtrack Design**: The music was designed to create a tense and unsettling atmosphere. Dark, ambient tones and unsettling melodies were used to build suspense and reflect the isolation felt by the player in the game.
  
- **Dynamic Sound Variation**: We incorporated dynamic changes in the music to match the pacing of the gameplay. Quiet, slow moments were paired with low, ominous tones, while moments of danger and action featured louder, more intense music to heighten the player's sense of urgency.

- **Instrumentation and Theme**: The instrumentation was chosen to match the horror genre, with deep strings, dissonant piano chords, and subtle sound effects to create an immersive experience. The music transitions smoothly between moments of tension and moments of action to reflect the flow of the gameplay.

- **Syncing Music with Gameplay**: A key focus was ensuring that the music was perfectly synced with the gameplay, enhancing key moments without overwhelming the player. The soundtrack was tailored to highlight moments of exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat in a seamless manner.
